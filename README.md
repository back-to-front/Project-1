## Overview

This is a portfolio website for a web developer. A simple site but this is responsive with many different components to show what I know.

## Functionality

- There is a navbar that is fixed to the top of the site
- The navbar allows you to easily jump between sections of the site
- The main section will adapt to many screen sizes, allowing the image to move around
- The portfolio section has a carousel to show different types of work that can be done
- There are 3 images of different work that is modeled for the customer
- There is a feedback section for the customer to get all the answers they need
- The feedback section is connected to form spree so I can see all messages submitted

## Technoloy Used

- I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
- HTML for the main website content
- CSS for styling the website
- Bootstrap for easy navbar, carousel, and other compenents

## Future Improvements

1. I would add a more atylish background. One with a orb that would follow the mouse cursor as you browse the site.
2. I would add more pages to seperate everything in there own page. I would like to have a projects completed or started for this.
3. Probably add more fields to the form section. Probably some radio buttons or a slider.
4. Add a pricing page to show the user what they could get for a set price
5. Add more to the about me section. More about my personal self, and more about the work they could get done.
6. Probably style the website differently. Go for more of a dark theme overall, change the sections up
